This is a porject that utilize the webGL interface of html5. You load model of type .pol, and control the size, position, direction of it easily. I also introduced a camera system so that you can wander around the scene! There are several shader you can choose for different render effect.
This library is free, but you must notify  that it is initiallized by 'POLARSKY' on the webpage that utilizing it.

I understand that this API library is ugly and may has a lot of faults. I am trying to make it more robust, and you help is also invaluable!
